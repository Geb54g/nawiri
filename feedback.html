                        “One of the therapists Nawiri  recommended told me something I think about everyday. 
                         I had asked if  I can experience good health with my mental illness.
                          He said that good mental health isn't about feeling happy and confident 100% of time and ignoring 
                          any problems,instead it's about living and coping well despite problems.”

                   “The audio tracks in Nawiri are so calming and relaxing!!
                     I've experienced decreased stress and annoyance ever since I started a routine of listening to them 
                     before I sleeping and also waking up to them..I know! I can't have enough. I am in decreased pain and improved mood,Thank you Nawiri!”

                    “I used to have an inability to cope with daily problems and stress with trouble understanding 
                    and relating to situations and to people and I thought I was alone in this. 
                    I could not afford going to therapy too and luckily I stumbled across Nawiri 
                    .They offer free services which are top tier. It has turned my life around”
